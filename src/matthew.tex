% Hi! We're member of IRIS-HEP and the Scikit-HEP community project, where we are building
% a Pythonic data analysis ecosystem for HEP community.
% IRIS-HEP does lots of things from data delivery, to cyberinfrastructure, and supporting the
% development of existing software tools, and has been a community center for fostering Scikit-HEP
% development.
% A shared goal is that we want to empower analysts at the LHC and beyond with modern data science stacks
% and build powerful libraries that allow for analysts to build expressive analysis workflows.

% Given that we're at the "Python exchange" we're not going to do a "Why Python" slide
% as we don't need to convert the choir, but what we can do it tell you a bit about how our
% community went from being C++ only to a 2 language C++ and Python community.
% This plot shows a survey that Jim Pivarski did of **users** of the code in the CMS experiment's (one of the main experiments at the
% Large Hadron Collider) software framework monorepo "CMSSW" which is publicly available on GitHub.
% He cross referenced the people who forked CMSSW (so filtering on particle physicists on CMS) and then searched _their_
% repositories for "import" statements in files.
% As we can see, before 2018 most of these imports were coming from C++.
% However, around 2018 we see a change where Python is becoming the dominant form of code that is actually being written
% by these users (both as scripts and in Jupyter).

% If we take a more detailed view of this survey, we can see that this increase in people writing more Python is also
% strongly tied with the use of scientific Python packages in the HEP community, as we see with numpy, matplotlib, pandas,
% and tensorflow.
% This is also tied with the rise of Scikit-HEP which got started around 2017 and IRIS-HEP late 2018 / early 2019, which you
% can see also with the appearance of tooling that came out of IRIS-HEP and Scikit-HEP like uproot and awkward Array.
